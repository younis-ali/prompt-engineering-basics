# Basics of Prompt Engineering and GenAI

## Overview

This project aims to provide basic insights into Large Language Models (LLM), Generative AI (GenAI), and Prompt Engineering. It is divided into two courses:

1. **Course 1: Prompt Engineering**
   - **Objective**: To help developers write effective prompts for interacting with LLMs and develop a guided chatbot.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Learn about different types of prompts and their impact on LLMs.
     - Understand best practices for crafting prompts.
     - Develop a guided chatbot using the OpenAI API.

2. **Course 2: Application Development using LLM and Langchain**
   - **Objective**: To demonstrate practical applications of LLMs and Langchain in real-world scenarios.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Implement LLM-based solutions for various tasks.
     - Explore the capabilities of Langchain for language processing.
     - Develop applications leveraging LLMs and Langchain.
